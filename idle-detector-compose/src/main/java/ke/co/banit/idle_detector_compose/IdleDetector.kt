/**
 * IdleDetector is a utility class that monitors user interactions and determines if the user
 * has been inactive for a specified timeout period.
 *
 * This class is designed to be used in a Jetpack Compose environment where idle detection
 * is needed (for example, for auto-logout or to trigger specific UI events after a period
 * of inactivity). It leverages Kotlin coroutines and StateFlow to periodically poll for
 * inactivity and expose the current idle state.
 *
 * ### Dependencies:
 * - **Kotlin Coroutines**: Used for asynchronous polling via [CoroutineScope], [Job],
 *   [Dispatchers.Main], and [delay]. The [SupervisorJob] is combined with the main dispatcher
 *   to ensure that failures in this scope do not cancel sibling coroutines.
 * - **Kotlinx.coroutines.flow.StateFlow**: Used to expose the idle state (_isIdle) to observers
 *   in a reactive manner.
 * - **Kotlin Duration**: Represents both the [timeout] duration (the period after which the user
 *   is considered idle) and the [pollingInterval] (how frequently the detector checks for inactivity).
 *
 * @property timeout The duration after which the user is considered idle if no interaction is registered.
 * @property pollingInterval The interval at which the detector polls to check if the user is idle.
